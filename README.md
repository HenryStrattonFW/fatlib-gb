Personal library of code for developing with GBDK

### Disclaimer
I'm a C# programmer by trade, I've not so much as had to think about signed vs unsigned values, or hexidecimal outside of it's use for colour since my University days. As such this code is likely to be subject to the following flaws:

1. This code will be far from optimal C.
2. Honestly people with C experience may see some of my code as 'offensively bad'
3. I may do things that are not considered good C practice just because it helps my simple C# brain model what's going on.

But hey, I'm not out here trying to make a sellable Gameboy game or provide super high quality code. This repo is just a bunch of code to help me in my hobbiest fiddlings with GBDK.
